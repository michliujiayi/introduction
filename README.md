# Hello World!
This is my first assignment in DS105! Let me tell you a little bit about myself.

My name is Michelle Liu and I am 20 years old. I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and spent about 12 years of my life there. Hong Kong is a very global city, and you have just about everything: from mountains to beaches, urban settings and parks etc. I went to a Singaporean International School, so the majority of my classes were taught in English.

In 2013, my family and I moved to Shenzhen, China. I also went to an international school there under the American curriculum. I played a variety of sports there, they include badminton, volleyball, basketball, touch rugby, and track. Although I didn't pursue these sports after middle school, I enjoyed them nevertheless.

I spent about 3 years in China before I went to boarding school in Worcester, Massachusetts. I learned a lot from being a boarding student; I became very independent and organized. There, I continued playing volleyball and played for the school team.

After my first year in high school, my family then moved to New Jersey. Although that is where I live, I wouldn't call New Jersey home. I have spent more time at my university in New York more than I have ever spent in New Jersey. 

My home university is Hamilton College, and it is located in Clinton, New York. I study Economics both there and here at LSE.

I am a rather dynamic person; I switch hobbies and gain/lose interest rather quickly. When I was younger, I danced ballet, did gymnastics, swimming, badminton, and even taekwando for 6 months. As I grew older, I began to lose interest in my activities, so now I have a few hobbies that I enjoy regularly. They include volleyball, listening to music, origami, and board games. I recently picked up an interest in philosophy books and I also enjoy being in nature. 

Although I'm not 100% certain about my future plans, I am trying to be as present as possible. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to study at LSE and live in one of the biggest cities in the world. I can't wait for what this year has in store!
