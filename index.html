    <title>A Brief Introduction</title>

  <body>
    My name is Michelle Liu and I am 20 years old. I am originally from Hong Kong but I have lived in the United States for the past 6 years. 
    My home university is Hamilton College, and it is located in Clinton, New York. I study Economics both there and here at LSE. 
    I am also interested in Data Science and Philosophy.
    
    I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and attended international schools my entire life. My family and I lived in Shenzhen, China for 3 years
    before I attended boarding school in Worcester, Massachussetts. After my first year in high school, my family then moved to New Jersey. 
    Although that is where I live, I wouldn't call New Jersey home. I have spent more time at my university in New York more than I have ever spent
    in New Jersey.
    
    I am a rather dynamic person; I switch hobbies and gain/lose interest rather quickly. When I was younger, I danced ballet, did gymnastics, 
    swimming, badminton, and even taekwando for 6 months. As I grew older, I began to lose interest in my activities, so now I have a few hobbies 
    that I enjoy regularly. They include volleyball, listening to music, origami, and board games. I recently picked up an interest in philosophy books
    and I also enjoy sitting in nature. 
    
    Although I'm not 100% certain about my future plans, I am trying to be as present as possible. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity 
    to study at LSE and live in one of the biggest cities in the world. I can't wait for what this year has in store!
